# The following datasets were selected for this project
- minuteSleep_merged
- weightLogInfo_merged
- dailyActivty_merged

These datasets were selected because they provided sufficient information to address the business task about analyzing smart device usage – specifically related to user behavior trends and how engaged they are with the available features. I opted to utilize datasets from March-April 2016 (1 month of the data provided) as the primary focus for analysis. This dataset contained sufficient information to track user behaviors across 3 wellness features and identify meaningful trends and pattern without added complexity. 
# Tools
- EXCEL
-  SQL
# Data Cleaning
Data cleaning and pre-processing were handled using Excel. The following cleaning tasks were performed across all datasets
- Checked for missing values
- Reviewed and appropriately formatted column data types 
- Checked for duplicate entries 

split timestamp columns into separate date and time columns for the following datasets
- minuteSleep_merged
- weightLogInfo_merged
# Analysis
## Activity
To understand the activity levels of users who collected their Fitbit data. I wanted to examine how active the users that wore their Fitbit daily were. This analysis explored users’ activity patterns, categorized users based on their activity levels (very, moderately or less active) and examined their activity behavior between the weekdays and the weekends.
## Sleep x Activity
Get an understanding of users sleep and activity behavior. Were the users who tracked sleep more active than those who did not? I examined how many users tracked their sleep, how much sleep they were getting on average and if sleep behaviors on the weekends and the weekdays differed
## Weight x Activity x Sleep
 In this analysis, I wanted to understand how users that engaged with the weight tracking feature, engaged with the rest of the Fitbit tracking ecosystem (activity and sleep). I examined who were the users that tracked weight data and examined their behavioral patterns compare to those who did not use this feature at all.
# Key Findings 
Users' mainly utilized the activity tracking feature of the Fitbit product. 35 users logged their activity data compared to 23 users tracking sleep and 11 tracking weight data.

Majority (68.6%, n=24) of users tracking their activity data with the Fitbit device were categorized as ‘less active’ users.

Users’ activity levels remained consistent over the weekdays and the weekends. Of the 13 users (37%) whose activity levels shifted, we saw a movement towards greater activity minutes for the weekday’s vs the weekends.

Activity level is not strongly related to user sleep behavior. On average, users classified as ‘very active’ get the same amount of sleep as ‘less active’ users.

# Conclusion
Fitness devices alone are not enough to get consumers into living an active lifestyle. From the analysis conducted we saw that 68% of the users were categorized as ‘less active’. This means that the average user was not in the very active zone for at least 30 mins in a month. With the leaf product, we want to promote our users to move. Sending out movement reminders, health information update reminders and having challenges where they can move and compete with friends could motivate our users to live a less sedentary lifestyle. 

**Based off these findings, we’d need to add in more data focused on the Bellabeat customer base. The data we looked at was anonymized and we did not have any demographics information to guide our findings. Since Bellabeat’s target audience is women, we’d need to identify more data from that demographic to better understand our customer niche. By adding more data with the specific target audience, we’d have a better understanding of how-to best market to the Bellabeat audience.**
